All these methods have the advantage of being able to cope seamlessly with input and state constraints when compared to reactive controllers, however, they substantially differ in the design of the cost function. In the NMPC impedance control the cost function includes the error from the desired impedance dynamics; in the NMPC cascaded control the cost function includes the error from a reference trajectory which is generated online by an admittance filter driven by the force measurement; and in the NMPC hybrid position/force control the cost function contains both the trajectory and direct force error. The three architectures are proposed, implemented, analysed, validated, and compared with real-time simulations of interaction tasks with different environments. The numerical investigation provides a set of insights about the performances, advantages, and dependency on the design assumptions of the three methods.","tags":["Aerial Robotics","Aerial Physical Interaction Control","Model Predective Control"],"title":"Three Fundamental Paradigms for Aerial Physical Interaction Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Regular ‘in-situ’ inspection and maintenance of wind turbines, especially the leading edge, is needed to ensure system efficiency and durability. Typical inspection and maintenance activities consist of a set of physical tasks, such as sanding, brushing, or painting at high altitudes, which are dangerous for human operators, time-consuming, and can only be carried out under certain conditions. If such activities are not done timely and steadily, it may result in significant downtime to the system due to the maintenance and even replacement which is also very expensive for the owner. The use of aerial robots with the ability of physical interaction that perform a variety of maintenance tasks proposes an advanced and consistent inspection and maintenance technique that mitigates limitations of the current approach. Although currently aerial robot applications to maintenance beyond monitoring and inspection tasks are not common, this research focuses on the applicability of aerial robots to carry out inspection and maintenance tasks that require physical interaction with the environment. The main contribution of this paper is a novel control system for the physical interaction of aerial robots that enables the maintenance of a 3D wind turbine blade. This work first aims at investigating and classifying the properties of wind turbine blade maintenance in order to identify the main requirements for control design. Then, we design and implement a controller based on the identified physical requirements. The applicability of the proposed control system of the aerial robot is demonstrated in a mock-up environment.","tags":["Aerial Robotics","Aerial Physical Interaction Control"],"title":"Physical Interacting Aerial Robots for ‘In-Situ’ Inspection and Maintenance of Wind Turbine Blade","type":"publication"}]
