More recently, thanks to the growing availability of efficient and more computationally powerful embedded computers, the popularity of MPC is broadening to safety and time-critical applications with fast dynamics, e.g., in the automotive and robotic fields. MPC popularity is mainly due to 1) its ability to optimize, in a predictive fashion, the system behaviour on a given future time horizon based on the system model; 2) it allows to enforce dynamic constraints on the state and the control inputs of a physical system; 3) it uses states feedback to mitigate possible model perturbations.\n\nIn this lecture, we will introduce MPC and especially Nonlinear MPC. After that we will develop a mathematical model for Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAVs), and then we will introduce practical use-cases for MPC to control MRAVs.\n\nThis workshop and visit were part of the Horizon-Europe AeroSTREAM project.

This raises many challenges in the modeling, control, perception, and planning of these robots. However, designing and realizing an AM testbed is a complicated multi-disciplinary task, and there is a lack of standardization in the relatively new field of AMs. For this purpose, we introduce Sarax, an open-source hardware and software framework tailored for AMs research and innovation. The software of Sarax is built on top of open-source projects such as the Robot Operating System (ROS) and PX4 Autopilot, while the hardware is designed to be customizable, modular, and easily scalable through parameterized models. We verified and validated the proposed framework through indoor and outdoor experiments. We aim to open the door to accelerate AMs research and innovation, allow researchers and developers to focus on their core contributions, and take AMs technology to a higher readiness level.","tags":["Aerial Robotics","Aerial Physical Interaction","Open Source"],"title":"Sarax: An Open-Source Software/Hardware Framework for Aerial Manipulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1697068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697068800,"objectID":"f3561856f36eca900bb4b579672557f1","permalink":"https://ayhamalharbat.github.io/talk/indoor-localization-using-optitrack-px4-autopilot-and-ros-2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/indoor-localization-using-optitrack-px4-autopilot-and-ros-2/","section":"event","summary":"\"How to use Motion Capture system like Optitrack with PX4 Autopilot and ROS 2 for indoor localization?\" this was the main question of this hands-on workshop that was delivered over two days in the Karlovac university of applied sciences in Croatia.

All these methods have the advantage of being able to cope seamlessly with input and state constraints when compared to reactive controllers, however, they substantially differ in the design of the cost function. In the NMPC impedance control the cost function includes the error from the desired impedance dynamics; in the NMPC cascaded control the cost function includes the error from a reference trajectory which is generated online by an admittance filter driven by the force measurement; and in the NMPC hybrid position/force control the cost function contains both the trajectory and direct force error. The three architectures are proposed, implemented, analysed, validated, and compared with real-time simulations of interaction tasks with different environments. The numerical investigation provides a set of insights about the performances, advantages, and dependency on the design assumptions of the three methods.","tags":["Aerial Robotics","Aerial Physical Interaction","Model Predective Control"],"title":"Three Fundamental Paradigms for Aerial Physical Interaction Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Will follow.

Regular ‚Äòin-situ‚Äô inspection and maintenance of wind turbines, especially the leading edge, is needed to ensure system efficiency and durability. Typical inspection and maintenance activities consist of a set of physical tasks, such as sanding, brushing, or painting at high altitudes, which are dangerous for human operators, time-consuming, and can only be carried out under certain conditions. If such activities are not done timely and steadily, it may result in significant downtime to the system due to the maintenance and even replacement which is also very expensive for the owner. The use of aerial robots with the ability of physical interaction that perform a variety of maintenance tasks proposes an advanced and consistent inspection and maintenance technique that mitigates limitations of the current approach. Although currently aerial robot applications to maintenance beyond monitoring and inspection tasks are not common, this research focuses on the applicability of aerial robots to carry out inspection and maintenance tasks that require physical interaction with the environment. The main contribution of this paper is a novel control system for the physical interaction of aerial robots that enables the maintenance of a 3D wind turbine blade. This work first aims at investigating and classifying the properties of wind turbine blade maintenance in order to identify the main requirements for control design. Then, we design and implement a controller based on the identified physical requirements. The applicability of the proposed control system of the aerial robot is demonstrated in a mock-up environment.","tags":["Aerial Robotics","Aerial Physical Interaction"],"title":"Physical Interacting Aerial Robots for ‚ÄòIn-Situ‚Äô Inspection and Maintenance of Wind Turbine Blade","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Current drone applications are limited to using drones for non-interactive tele-detection, ‚Äúeyes and noses in the air‚Äù. The following breakthrough is tele-interaction, ‚Äúhands in the air‚Äù.

The research mainly focuses on the question of whether it is possible to develop a prototype of a modular and completely autonomous aerial manipulator that can physically interact with a realistic outdoor environment. In essence, the aerial manipulator acts as ‚Äúarms and hands in the air‚Äù, which can be used for both active and passive aerial interaction. The applicability of this technology will be demonstrated in three chosen application domains, inspection and maintenance (maintenance of offshore windmill and cleaning solar panels), agriculture (selective treatment of plants and sample picking) and Safety and Security (active firefighting).\nFunded by Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO.
